# Radiative Transfer Simulation in High Redshift Galaxies

This repository presents the results of two research articles in the field of Astrophysics, specifically focusing on the study of light emission behavior in high redshift galaxies.

### 1) Dust Temperature and Emission of FirstLight Simulated Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn (2022)

In this study, we employed POLARIS as a Monte Carlo photon transport simulator to investigate the dust temperature (Tdust) and infrared emission of FirstLight simulated galaxies at redshifts 6 and 8. Our simulations provided 3D maps of equilibrium dust temperature within the Interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, along with sight-line infrared emission maps. Key findings highlight the significant impact of excess heating of dust by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation at high redshifts, leading to increased Mid and Far infrared (M-FIR) dust emission. The different evaluations of dust temperature models were correlated with the optical and intrinsic properties of galaxies.

### 2) Dust Attenuation in Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn from the FirstLight Simulations (2023)

This study delves into the behavior of dust in galaxies at cosmic dawn (ùëß = 6 ‚àí 8) by integrating FirstLight simulations with the radiative transfer code POLARIS. The starburst nature and intricate dust distribution in these galaxies result in diverse attenuation curves. While relatively massive galaxies follow the Calzetti model, those with lower masses exhibit steeper curves consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) model. The attenuation curve slopes in the ultraviolet and optical regions are closer to the modified Calzetti model, with a slight preference for the power-law model in galaxies with the highest attenuation values. Additionally, we explore the relationship between the far-ultraviolet slope (ùõΩùëàùëâ) and infrared excess (IRX), observing shifts in these parameters at different redshifts, influenced by factors such as metallicity and Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.
